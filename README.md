Rock Paper Scissors (CLI Game)

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with Javascript, designed to run entirely in the terminal. The player competes against the computer, which makes random choices each round.

The game handles user input safely, normalizes input to avoid case-sensitivity issues, and determines the winner using a numeric mapping strategy instead of repetitive conditional checks. This keeps the logic compact, readable, and scalable.

Players can:

>Enter rock, paper, or scissors to play

>Type exit to quit the game at any time

>Instantly see the result of each round in the terminal
